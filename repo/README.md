A persistent DOI for the code archive is available via Zenodo: `[DOI to be added at acceptance]`

## Data source

The analysis uses the publicly available [MOOCCubeX dataset](https://github.com/THU-KEG/MOOCCubeX), specifically:

- `relations/user-xiaomu.json` — 108,351 AI assistant interactions
- `relations/user-problem.json` — 22.45 GB of problem-attempt records
- `entities/problem.json` — Problem metadata (1.29 GB)
- `entities/course.json` — Course metadata (44.7 MB)

The MOOCCubeX dataset is **not** redistributed in this repository; users should obtain it directly from the source. Once downloaded, place the files in a directory at the path expected by the data extraction scripts (configurable in `01_data_extraction/01_inspect_files.py`).

## How to reproduce the analyses

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Approximately 50 GB of free disk space (for the raw MOOCCubeX files)
- The Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 1 — Obtain the data

Download the MOOCCubeX dataset (see "Data source" above) and place the relevant files in a working directory. The data extraction scripts assume a structure like:

```
data/
└── MOOCCubeX/
    ├── relations/
    │   ├── user-xiaomu.json
    │   ├── user-problem.json
    │   └── user-video.json
    └── entities/
        ├── problem.json
        ├── course.json
        ├── concept.json
        └── user.json
```

You will also need the main analytic dataset `combined_ai_learning_data.csv` (16,389 rows, one per student), which is constructed from `user-xiaomu.json` and a subset of `user-problem.json`. The construction script for this file is not included here because it is part of the original analysis pipeline that predates this revision; the file itself is treated as input to the four robustness analyses below.

### Step 2 — Build the (user × course) accuracy dataset

Required only for the multilevel analysis.

```bash
cd 01_data_extraction/
python 01_inspect_files.py          # diagnostic; verifies file paths
python 01b_inspect_linkage.py       # confirms problem→exercise→course linkage
python 01c_verify_id_match.py       # confirms ID-matching strategy
python 02_extract_user_course_accuracy.py
```

This produces `user_course_accuracy.csv` (143,385 rows, one per `(user, course)` cell), used by the multilevel analysis.

### Step 3 — Run the four robustness analyses

```bash
cd 02_analysis/

python within_group_analysis.py     # Section 4.6.1
python three_category_analysis.py   # Section 4.6.2
python multilevel_analysis.py       # Section 4.6.3
python compute_irr.py               # Section 3.4 (requires Coding_Sheet_Coder*.xlsx)
```

Each script writes its result files to `03_results/` (existing files in the repository) and produces a figure (`Figure_*.png`/`.pdf`) corresponding to the figures in the manuscript.

### Step 4 — Verify against the archived results

The expected outputs are archived in `03_results/`. Re-running the scripts on the same input data should reproduce these files identically.

## Key empirical findings (for reference)

The convergent finding across all three statistical robustness analyses is that the aggregate negative correlation between effective feedback usage and accuracy (*r* = −.102) is a between-group structural pattern, not a within-context effect:

| Analysis | Key result |
|---|---|
| Within-tertile correlation | All three tertile-internal correlations near zero (Low: *r* = +.008; Medium: *r* = +.006; High: *r* = −.020) |
| Three-category decomposition | Knowledge Graph Navigation drives the aggregate correlation (KG: *r* = −.107; other process-level: *r* = −.013; self-regulation: *r* = +.006) |
| Multilevel modelling | EF% effect on accuracy disappears (b = +.002, *p* = .85) once course is partialled out (ICC = .394) |
| Inter-rater reliability | Cohen's κ = .716 across two independent coders, 13 of 16 features with full agreement |
